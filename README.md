# React Development with AI - Beginner's Guide

## Modern Development Philosophy 🤖

**Welcome to the AI age of coding!** You don't need to memorize every syntax or write everything from scratch. Focus on:
- Understanding React fundamentals and structure
- Learning how components work together
- Knowing what you want to build
- Let AI handle the implementation details

**Key mindset:** Know the "what" and "why" - let AI handle the "how"

---

## Prerequisites
- Node.js installed (https://nodejs.org)
- VS Code with GitHub Copilot extension
- Basic understanding of HTML/CSS/JavaScript concepts

---

## 1. Open Terminal and Create Project Folder

### Windows:
```bash
# Open Command Prompt or PowerShell
# Navigate to where you want your project
cd C:\Users\YourName\Documents\Projects

# Create and enter project folder
mkdir my-react-projects
cd my-react-projects
```

### Mac/Linux:
```bash
# Open Terminal
# Navigate to your preferred location
cd ~/Documents/Projects

# Create and enter project folder
mkdir my-react-projects
cd my-react-projects
```

---

## 2. Initialize React Project

### For Web Apps (Most Common):
```bash
# Create new React app with Vite (faster than Create React App)
npm create vite@latest my-web-app -- --template react
cd my-web-app
npm install
```

### For Mobile Apps (Expo):
```bash
# Install Expo CLI globally
npm install -g @expo/cli

# Create new Expo app
npx create-expo-app my-mobile-app
cd my-mobile-app
```

### For Web Apps with Router (Multi-page sites):
```bash
# Create React app first
npm create vite@latest my-website -- --template react
cd my-website
npm install

# Add React Router
npm install react-router-dom
```

---

## 3. Understanding React Project Structure

Before diving into coding, let's understand what each folder and file does in your React project:

### 📁 Typical React Project Structure
```
my-react-app/
├── public/                 # Static files served directly
│   ├── index.html         # Main HTML template
│   ├── favicon.ico        # Website icon
│   └── images/            # Static images, icons
├── src/                   # Source code (where you'll work most)
│   ├── components/        # Reusable UI components
│   │   ├── Header.jsx     # Navigation header
│   │   ├── Button.jsx     # Custom button component
│   │   └── Card.jsx       # Card component
│   ├── pages/             # Full page components
│   │   ├── Home.jsx       # Home page
│   │   ├── About.jsx      # About page
│   │   └── Contact.jsx    # Contact page
│   ├── hooks/             # Custom React hooks
│   │   └── useAuth.js     # Authentication hook
│   ├── utils/             # Helper functions
│   │   └── api.js         # API calls
│   ├── styles/            # CSS files
│   │   ├── globals.css    # Global styles
│   │   └── components.css # Component styles
│   ├── App.jsx            # Main app component
│   ├── main.jsx           # Entry point (Vite)
│   └── index.css          # Main CSS file
├── package.json           # Dependencies and scripts
└── vite.config.js         # Build configuration
```

### 🎯 What Each Folder Does:

**📂 `public/`** - Static Assets
- Files served directly to browser
- `index.html` - The single HTML page your React app loads into
- Put images, icons, fonts here
- **When to use**: Static images, favicons, manifest files

**📂 `src/`** - Your Main Workspace
- All your React code lives here
- This is where you'll spend 90% of your time
- **When to use**: Everything you write in React

**📂 `src/components/`** - Reusable UI Pieces
- Small, reusable components
- Think: buttons, cards, modals, forms
- **Example**: Header, Footer, ProductCard, SearchBar
- **When to use**: When you need the same UI element in multiple places

**📂 `src/pages/`** - Full Page Components
- Complete pages/views of your app
- Each page typically has its own route
- **Example**: HomePage, AboutPage, ProfilePage
- **When to use**: Different screens/views in your app

**📂 `src/hooks/`** - Custom Logic
- Custom React hooks for shared logic
- **Example**: useAuth, useLocalStorage, useApi
- **When to use**: When you need to share logic between components

**📂 `src/utils/`** - Helper Functions
- Pure JavaScript functions
- **Example**: formatDate, calculateTotal, validateEmail
- **When to use**: Reusable functions that don't need React

**📂 `src/styles/`** - Styling Files
- CSS, SCSS, or styled-components
- **When to use**: When you want organized styling

### 🔍 Key Files Explained:

**`App.jsx`** - The Main Component
```jsx
// This is your app's main component
// All other components get rendered through this
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Header />
      <MainContent />
      <Footer />
    </div>
  )
}
```

**`main.jsx`** - Entry Point (Vite)
```jsx
// This file starts your React app
// You rarely need to modify this
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
import App from './App.jsx'

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(<App />)
```

**`package.json`** - Project Configuration
```json
{
  "name": "my-react-app",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",        // Start development server
    "build": "vite build", // Build for production
    "preview": "vite preview" // Preview production build
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^18.2.0"    // Your project dependencies
  }
}
```

### 🎨 For Projects with React Router:

```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── Layout.jsx         # Wraps all pages
│   └── Navigation.jsx     # Navigation menu
├── pages/
│   ├── Home.jsx
│   ├── About.jsx
│   └── Contact.jsx
├── routes/
│   └── AppRoutes.jsx      # Route definitions
└── App.jsx                # Main app with router
```

### 🗂️ Where to Edit What:

**Want to change the page title?** → `public/index.html`
**Want to add a new page?** → Create file in `src/pages/`
**Want to create a reusable button?** → Create file in `src/components/`
**Want to add navigation?** → Create/edit `src/components/Navigation.jsx`
**Want to change overall app structure?** → Edit `src/App.jsx`
**Want to add global styles?** → Edit `src/index.css`
**Want to add a new route?** → Edit your routes file

### 💡 Pro Tips:

1. **Start Simple**: Don't create too many folders initially
2. **Follow Conventions**: Use PascalCase for components (Header.jsx, not header.jsx)
3. **Group Related Files**: Keep component and its CSS together
4. **Use Descriptive Names**: `UserProfile.jsx` is better than `Profile.jsx`

### 🚀 Quick Start Locations:

**For beginners, you'll mostly work in:**
- `src/App.jsx` - Main app structure
- `src/components/` - Your reusable components
- `src/pages/` - Your different pages
- `src/index.css` - Basic styling

**Advanced folders you'll use later:**
- `src/hooks/` - Custom hooks
- `src/utils/` - Helper functions
- `src/context/` - Global state management

## 4. The ASK-First Rule for AI Development

### 🔴 IMPORTANT: Always ASK before AGENT

**Step 1: Use ASK Mode First**
Before writing any code, use the ASK feature to plan:

```
@ask I want to build a simple todo app with React. Can you help me plan the structure and approach?
```

**What ASK mode does:**
- Creates a blueprint of your project
- Breaks down the task into manageable pieces
- Helps you understand the approach
- Ensures AI alignment with your vision

**Example ASK conversation:**
```
You: @ask I want to build a simple e-commerce product page with React

AI: I'll help you plan a React e-commerce product page. Let me break this down:

Structure:
- Product image gallery
- Product details (name, price, description)
- Add to cart functionality
- Reviews section

Components needed:
- ProductImage component
- ProductInfo component
- AddToCart component
- ReviewsList component

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these components or discuss the state management approach?
```

**Step 2: Refine the Plan**
Continue the conversation to refine:
```
You: @ask Can you elaborate on the state management? I'm a beginner.

AI: For a beginner, I recommend starting with React's built-in useState for:
- Cart items count
- Selected product image
- Product quantity

This keeps it simple without external libraries like Redux.
```

**Step 3: Only Then Use AGENT Mode**
Once you have a clear plan, use AGENT mode:
```
@agent Based on our discussion, can you create the ProductImage component with image gallery functionality?
```

## 5. Run Project in Development Mode

### For Web Apps:
```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Your app will open at http://localhost:5173 (Vite)
# or http://localhost:3000 (Create React App)
```

### For Mobile Apps (Expo):
```bash
# Start Expo development server
npx expo start

# Scan QR code with Expo Go app on your phone
# Or press 'w' to open in web browser
```

### Hot Reloading Magic ✨
- Save any file and see changes instantly
- No need to refresh browser
- Perfect for rapid development

---

## 6. Build and Run Production

### For Web Apps:
```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# The build folder contains optimized files
# You can deploy this folder to any web hosting service

# To preview production build locally:
npm run preview
```

### For Mobile Apps (Expo):
```bash
# Build for Android
npx expo build:android

# Build for iOS (requires Mac)
npx expo build:ios

# For web deployment
npx expo export:web
```
